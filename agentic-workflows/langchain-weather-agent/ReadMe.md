Agentic Workflows: LangChain Weather Agent and Document Summarizer
===============================================================================
This repository contains two distinct agentic workflows built using LangChain: a Weather Agent that fetches and summarizes weather information, and a Document Summarizer that processes and summarizes text documents. Both agents leverage the capabilities of language models to perform their tasks effectively.

Weather Agent
-----------------
The Weather Agent is designed to retrieve current weather information for a specified location and provide a concise summary. It utilizes a weather API to fetch real-time data and employs a language model to generate human-readable summaries.

Document Summarizer
-----------------------
The Document Summarizer is built to process text documents and generate summaries that capture the main points. It uses natural language processing techniques to analyze the content and produce coherent summaries.
